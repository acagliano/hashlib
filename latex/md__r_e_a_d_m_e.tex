This is the stable branch of the TI-\/84+ CE toolchain library HASHLIB. ~\newline
 To build this library yourself, navigate into the {\ttfamily src} directory of the CE C toolchain. ~\newline
 Once in there, run {\ttfamily git clone \href{https://github.com/acagliano/hashlib.git}{\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/acagliano/hashlib.\+git}} hashlib}. ~\newline
 cd into that directory and run {\ttfamily make}. HASHLIB should be created. ~\newline


Of course there\textquotesingle{}s no need to actually do this, because an up to date build of HASHLIB is provided in this repository. ~\newline
 To use it with the toolchain, simply send {\ttfamily HASHLIB.\+8xv} to your device, move {\ttfamily hashlib.\+lib} into {\ttfamily \$\+CEDEV/lib/libload} and then {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{hashlib_8h}{hashlib.\+h}}} into {\ttfamily \$\+CEDEV/include}. ~\newline
 Once that is done, simply {\ttfamily \#include $<$\mbox{\hyperlink{hashlib_8h}{hashlib.\+h}}$>$} in your project source and you can use all the cryptography functions in the library. ~\newline


This library provides the following implementations tested and working on the TI-\/84+ CE. ~\newline
 You can view the C codebase by running {\ttfamily git checkout dev}. ~\newline


$<$$>$ A Secure PRNG with a calculated entropy of $\sim$107.1 bits per 32-\/bit random number and an evaluated advantage negligibly greater than zero. The statistics included in the repo are for 1 MB of random output. ~\newline
 $<$$>$ A 128, 192, and 256 bit AES implementation, in CBC mode. ~\newline
 $<$$>$ $\ast$$\ast$ Work in Progress $\ast$$\ast$ 1024-\/bit RSA, encryption-\/only. ~\newline
 $<$$>$ SHA-\/1 and SHA-\/256 cryptographic hashes (these guys are a bit on the slow side). ~\newline
 $<$$>$ A helper function to pad plaintexts for encryption. Pass plaintext, an output buffer of appropriate size (macros to return that size included), the algorithm, and a padding spec (or SCHM\+\_\+\+DEFAULT). The following padding methods are available\+: ~\newline

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item SCHM\+\_\+\+PKCS7 \+: AES padding, Pad with padding size \mbox{[}DEFAULT FOR AES\mbox{]}. ~\newline

\item SCHM\+\_\+\+ISO\+\_\+\+M2 \+: AES padding, Pad with \mbox{[}0x80, 0x00, ..., 0x00\mbox{]}. ~\newline

\item SCHM\+\_\+\+ISO\+\_\+\+M1 \+: AES padding, Pad with \mbox{[}0x00, ..., 0x00\mbox{]}. ~\newline

\item SCHM\+\_\+\+ANSIX923 \+: AES padding, Pad with \mbox{[}randbytes\mbox{]}. ~\newline

\item SCHM\+\_\+\+RSA\+\_\+\+OAEP \+: RSA padding, uses the OAEP padding scheme. SHA-\/256 is the hash used, and it is applied cyclically to the plaintext. ~\newline
 $<$$>$ A function to zero out a context that you no longer are using to prevent state leak. ~\newline
 $<$$>$ Base64 encoding and decoding functions. ~\newline
