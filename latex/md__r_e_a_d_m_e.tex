This library is written as a libload-\/compatibile C (and ASM) library. To install the lib into the toolchain, simply navigate into the hashlib directory within a terminal of your choice and type {\ttfamily make install}. Alternatively, you can manually move {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{hashlib_8h}{hashlib.\+h}}} into {\ttfamily \$\+CEDEV/include} and {\ttfamily hashlib.\+lib} into {\ttfamily \$\+CEDEV/lib/libload}. Also, be sure to send {\ttfamily HASHLIB.\+8xv} to your TI-\/84+ CE.
